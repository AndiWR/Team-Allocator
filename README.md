<h1>Team Allocator Program</h1>

<h3>Purpose</h3>
I'm an acocuntant who trying to learn data analysis, I write this program as an exercise to learn and familiarize myself with python, if by chance you find a creative way to use this script feel free to use it.
<br/>
<br/>

<h3>What I've learned from this project:</h3>
1. Creating list in python,<br/>
2. Loops in python,<br/>
3. Random module in python, and <br/>
4. Branching statement in python.
<br/>
<br/>

<h3>Assumption</h3>
1. The total number of the team member are even.<br/>
2. The name of the team member in the list are fixed.<br/>
3. The program allocate all team member into 2 teams.
<br/>
<br/>

<h3>How to Use it</h3>
Pretty straightforward, the program will allocate the team member into 2 team and also select one of the team member as Captain. You can allocate the team member many times until you're statisfied with the team allocation.
<br/>
<br/>

<h3>Planned Feature</h3>
1. Replace team member names with player numbers to allow for customized team member allocation.<br/>
2. Enable customization of the number of teams (supporting more than two teams). <br/>
3. Ensure the program can allocate all team members, even if the total number of team members or the number of teams is uneven.
