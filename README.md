<h1>Team Allocator Program</h1>

<h3>Purpose</h3>
I'm an acocuntant who trying to learn data analysis, I make this program mainly to learn and familiarize myself with python, but feel free to use it.
<br/>
<br/>

<h3>Assumption</h3>
What I've learned from this project:<br/>
1. Creating list in python,
2. Loops in python
<br/>
<br/>

<h3>Assumption</h3>
1. The total number of the team member are even,<br/>
2. The name of the team member in the list are fixed,<br/>
3. The program allocate all team member into 2 teams.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<h3>How to Use it</h3>
Pretty straightforward, the program will allocate the team member into 2 team and also select one of the team member as Captain. You can allocate the team member many times until you're statisfied with the team allocation
<br/>
<br/>

<h3>Planned Feature</h3>
1. Change the team member name in list into player number to address customized team member allocation,<br/>
2. Customize the number of team (more than 2 team)
3. I want to make the program to be able to allocateall team member even if: the total of team member is uneven or the total of team to be made are uneven
